                        <h3>LION</h3>
                        <p>Lions have almost no predators. However, old, sick lions are sometimes attacked, killed and eaten by hyenas. And very young lions can be killed by hyenas, leopards and other predators when they are not being watched carefully by their mothers. But a healthy adult lion has little to fear from any other animal.</p>
                        <p>Lions are most active at night and live in a variety of habitats but prefer grassland, savanna, dense scrub, and open woodland. Historically, they ranged across much of Europe, Asia, and Africa, but now they are found mainly in parts of Africa south of the Sahara.</p>
                       
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the lions in the Northern frontier</p>
